## Instructions
Refer to the [JavaScript Cheat Sheet](../../cheatSheet.js) for reminders on certain concepts.

**Compiling your code:** Run `node path/to/typescript/file` in your terminal to execute your code in the terminal.

E.g. if my terminal is in `~/SSE/Workshops`, I will run `node workshop-02-typescript/practice-problems/problem-1/main.ts`

In `main.ts` (TypeScript file):
1. Create a variable userName of type string and assign your name to it.
2. Create an array favoriteFoods that holds 3 different strings representing your favorite foods.
3. Create an object user with the following properties:
    name: the value of userName (string)
    age: a number (use any value)
    favoriteFoods: the favoriteFoods array (array of strings)
4. Print the user object and access one of the favorite foods using the array.

## Instructions
Refer to the [JavaScript Cheat Sheet](../../cheatSheet.js) for reminders on certain concepts.

**Compiling your code:** Run `node path/to/typescript/file` in your terminal to execute your code in the terminal.

E.g. if my terminal is in `~/SSE/Workshops`, I will run `node workshop-02-typescript/practice-problems/problem-2/main.ts`

In `main.ts` (TypeScript file):
1. Copy and paste the code from last problem into this file, then comment the code out from the last problem.
2. Write a function `displayUserInfo` that takes a user object as an argument.
3. The function should print the userâ€™s name, age, and a list of their favorite foods.
4. Call the function and pass the user object from the previous exercise.
